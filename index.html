  I am currently learning to code with Code First Girls. Going over everything from how the
  internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
  Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...
  </p>

  <p>HTML is cool</p>
  <p>CSS is cooler</p>
  <p>JS is the best</p>
  <br>

  <h2>What do you need to create a website?</h2>

  <p>Not much!<p>
  <p>  A computer (always a good start)</p>
  <p>A text editor (I am using atom)</p>
  <p>A web browser (I am using chrome)</p>
  <p>Some HTML, CSS and JS files</p>
